## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

I am proud that I have taken a lot reference to do the JavaScript solution and all of it is my creation. I am confident that I am improving in the logic making. My code is really long. I want to know how to use a shorter code that is more optimized.

Challenges I encountered is figuring out how each field when left empty must show the mandotry field error message individually, I had brainstormed and created a logic on my own to create individual flag for each field.

### Continued development

I have not addeed the astrisk to show that some of the fields are mandatory and the others are not. I have used the text area to enter the message. This area is resizable. But when we pull it with the help of cursor, it goes out of the container. I need to set the max width.
